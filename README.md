### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<hr>
My name is Takunda Muzunze and I am a UX Design Intern & current Computer Science student.

My interest for UX/UI design began in my secondary school studies where I had undertook user research and web design for a school assignment in my IT class. This was also my first introduction to web development, specifically front-end. Continuing to study Computing at my A Levels & at University is where I expanded upon my knowledge within UX/UI and also web development.

Now I am a current UX Design Intern @ Elephans, still completing personal side projects and learning new technologies in my spare time.
